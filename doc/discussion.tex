In this paper, we introduce moment matching for computing optimal variational 
distributions in the exponential family which substantially reduces the 
computation time compared to previous methods. For the Gaussian case, 
the result simplifies for all three variational methods, $\Imarg$, $\Ipost$,
and $\Iml$, to be moment matching the same joint Gaussian distribution. We 
demonstrate the substantial computational speed up, relative accuracy, and wide
use-case of $\Iml$. For future work, we would like to explore conditions to 
classify when the moment matched solution is a global minimum as well as 
generalizing the method to other exponential family distributions besides the
Gaussian case.
