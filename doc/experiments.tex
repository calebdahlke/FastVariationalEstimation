We demonstrate efficacy and efficiency of our moment matching
variational MI estimators in a range of experiments beginning with a
Gaussian mixture model (\SEC\ref{sec:gmm}).  We then evaluate two
implicit likelihood models: one arising from the non-closed-form
marginalization of nuisance variables in a GLM
(\SEC\ref{sec:extrapolation}), and the other is a simulation-based SIR
epidemiology model (\SEC\ref{sec:sir}).  In all cases we find that the
proposed moment matching estimators offer substantial computational
speedups while achieving identical MI bounds and approximations to
existing methods.

%% A variety of experiments are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the 
%% Moment Matching of the Implicit Likelihood approximation compared to a 
%% variety of other approaches. The experiments chosen are joint 
%% multivariate Gaussian Mixture Model, and implicit extrapolation setting,
%% and SIR parameter estimation. We demonstrate two major takeaways. First, 
%% Moment Matching is substantially faster than Gradient based approaches 
%% for finding optimal variational distributions and second, we show that 
%% the Implicit Likelihood approximation does not sacrifice accuracy of 
%% approximation compared to Variational Posterior or Variational Marginal, 
%% which assumes exact marginal entropy or exact posterior calculation, 
%% respectively.
